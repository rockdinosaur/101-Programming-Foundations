#A string is considered to be in title case if each word in the string is either (a) capitalised (that is, only the first letter of the word is in upper case) or (b) considered to be an exception and put entirely into lower case unless it is the first word, which is always capitalised.

#Write a function that will convert a string into title case, given an optional list of exceptions (minor words). The list of minor words will be given as a string with each word separated by a space. Your function should ignore the case of the minor words string -- it should behave in the same way even if the case of the minor word string is changed.

###Arguments (Haskell)

# First argument: space-delimited list of minor words that must always be lowercase except for the first word in the string.
# Second argument: the original string to be converted.
###Arguments (Other languages)

# First argument (required): the original string to be converted.
# Second argument (optional): space-delimited list of minor words that must always be lowercase except for the first word in the string. The JavaScript/CoffeeScript tests will pass undefined when this argument is unused.
# ###Example

# title_case('a clash of KINGS', 'a an the of') # should return: 'A Clash of Kings'
# title_case('THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS', 'The In') # should return: 'The Wind in the Willows'
# title_case('the quick brown fox') # should return: 'The Quick Brown Fox'

# Take a Number And Sum Its Digits Raised To The Consecutive Powers And ....Â¡Eureka!!
# The number 89 is the first integer with more than one digit that fulfills the property partially introduced in the title of this kata. What's the use of saying "Eureka"? Because this sum gives the same number.
#
# In effect: 89 = 8^1 + 9^2
#
# The next number in having this property is 135.
#
# See this property again: 135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3
#
# We need a function to collect these numbers, that may receive two integers a, b that defines the range [a, b] (inclusive) and outputs a list of the sorted numbers in the range that fulfills the property described above.
#
# Let's see some cases:
#
# sum_dig_pow(1, 10) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
#
# sum_dig_pow(1, 100) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]
# If there are no numbers of this kind in the range [a, b] the function should output an empty list.

# Number of people in the bus
#
# There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.
#
# You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays (or tuples). Each integer array has two items which represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.
#
# Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D
#
# Take a look on the test cases.
#
# Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the return integer can't be negative.
#
# The second value in the first integer array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.

# Build a pile of Cubes
# Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3.
